<h3>Whole Brain Paragraph</h3>
Music is one of my passions. Whether Iâ€™m practicing on playing on my guitar or finding new artists to listen to. Music can be used as the perfect background noise to any given situation and can set the mood. It helps me concentrate while working on a project, get into a serious gaming session, or allowing me to meditate while connecting to a spiritual plane.

<h2>Weekly Reflections</h2>

<h3>Week 1</h3>
My first week of boot camp has been exciting and fun. Meet 7 other people whom I will be getting to know over the 12 weeks. Four students including myself conceptualized, brainstormed, and developed a new boardgame which we are considering digitizing turning into a mobile game. Also, Rod has presented multiple projects to us for to possibly collaborate or do individually.
